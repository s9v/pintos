   A lock is a specialization of a semaphore with an initial
   value of 1.  The difference between a lock and such a
   semaphore is twofold.  First, a semaphore can have a value
   greater than 1, but a lock can only be owned by a single
   thread at a time.  Second, a semaphore does not have an owner,
   meaning that one thread can "down" the semaphore and then
   another one "up" it, but with a lock the same thread must both
   acquire and release it.  When these restrictions prove
   onerous, it's a good sign that a semaphore should be used,
